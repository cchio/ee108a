    Number used as Memory:                       7 out of  17,920    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             7
        Number using O6 output only:             7
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         5

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   205 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          597
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           280 out of     597   46%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 125 out of     597   20%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         192 out of     597   32%
    Number of unique control sets:              48
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             112 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       3 out of     148    2%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  3
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               1
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               2
    Total Memory used (KB):                     72 out of   5,328    1%
