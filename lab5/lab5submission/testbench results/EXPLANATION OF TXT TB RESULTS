EXPLANATION OF TXT TB RESULTS
------------------------------
Group 18, Lab 5

wave_capture_tb:
	The sample input is just being incremented to give us different values, but it is not following a sine wave.
	We are checking that the addresses are right and the output samples are right.
	The test bench results are prety self explanatory and are what we have expected.	

preset_counter_tb:
	What this testbench is doing is counting through its values with each cycle of beat. 
	With each cycle, the counter increments.
	The test bench results are prety self explanatory and are what we have expected.
